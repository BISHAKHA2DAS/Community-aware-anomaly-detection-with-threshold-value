# Community-aware-anomaly-detection-with-threshold-value
The anomalies in the graph is detected and top anomalies crossing threshold value is identified.
The community is divided by the community detection algorithm Louvain.
Then the anomalies are detected using Community aware detection algorithm.
It is used to search anomaly in a complex network.
Infomap package is used.
It focuses on the global prospective
Here, higher score refers to the higher divergence from the expected behaviour.
